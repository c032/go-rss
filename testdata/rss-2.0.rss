								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;">About My Partners&#8230;¹</h2>
<hr />
<h6 style="text-align:right;">kurokurori.wordpress.com</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who and what decides a human&#8217;s personality?<br />
The <span class="meaning-meaning">belief that human nature is fundamentally good,<br />
And the belief that human nature is fundamentally evil.<br />
A human&#8217;s real nature is just.<br />
A human&#8217;s real nature is evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="meaning-meaning">Who decides between these two thoughts?<br />
I was thinking about such cliched subject.</span></p>
<p>Good and Evil.<br />
Who decides these fundamental standards?<br />
Is it the society? Is it the world? Is it nature?<br />
Or is it perhaps something the person decides for themselves?<br />
If it causes harm to other people then it&#8217;s considered evil?<br />
Or would it be considered that even if you commit a societal crime, you would still be considered &#8220;just&#8221; if you can earn fame and fortune out of it?</p>
<p>Still, in the end, people can have varying degrees of understanding regarding the judgment whether something is good or bad.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to the topic.<br />
What if someone was previously &#8220;good&#8221;? And what if someone was previously &#8220;bad&#8221;?<br />
This is just my opinion, but I think the happier someone is, the more they are able to sympathize with others and had more leeway to think of other people, and on the other hand, if one were to continuously face ordeals, they will start to think only about themselves and stopped having the leeway to think of others.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s this saying; &#8220;A good person is either a fool or someone who hasn&#8217;t been tested&#8221;.</p>
<p>Good and Evil.<br />
People live while maintaining that delicate balance within them.</p>
<p>Normally, people would be born showered with love and raised happily, and that was why they inclined towards being good. Though as they grow older, they start to face hardships one after another, and because of that, they either gradually distance themselves from others or they would be kind to others despite understanding their hardships.</p>
<p>At one point, for some people, this balance between good and evil would crumble.</p>
<p>By then, I think that person would be considered a madman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Edgar, when are you going to stop lazing around?&#8221; Ellie murmured towards me who was lying face-down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about the psychology of this world, Ellie-kun&#8230;!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t get you&#8230;Besides, I can&#8217;t clean the area below the sofa if you&#8217;re there, so get out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said so with a slight smug face, but Ellie ignored it as she pushed the stick end of the broom to my cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yusht a widdle ish fine wite? (Just a little is fine, right?)&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No. Go away, hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellie&#8217;s eyebrows gradually slanted to express her anger, so I retreated to my own room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the end this place calms me the most&#8230;&#8221;, I said to my partner in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uoooooh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Letting out a meaningless sigh, I spread my arms and legs and dived into my futon.</p>
<p>—But,</p>
<p>&#8220;Kyah!&#8221;</p>
<p>What greeted me on my dive wasn&#8217;t the soft sensation of my partner, but instead, something is alive in my bed.</p>
<p>Just when I was jumping into it, I could see something squirming on it.<br />
As I look closer at it, I could see a bulge resembling a single person.</p>
<p>&#8220;No way, right&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>As I flipped open the blanket, the previous visitor was there.<br />
The color of her skin and her hair were snow white, and her red eyes gleamed like a pair of rubies.</p>
<p>—it was Arisa.</p>
<p>She curled her body as she buried herself in my bed.<br />
Cautiously, she straightened herself and looked up at me before muttering;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You found me&#8230;well, can&#8217;t help it, so I&#8217;ll go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arisa poked her face out from under the blanket and dejectedly got off from the bed.<br />
She silently passed through my side, but just as she was about to pass by, I caught her by her shoulder.</p>
<p>I tried to smile as best as I can, but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing, Arisa?&#8221;</p>
<p>My cheek twitched.</p>
<p>I failed.<br />
I bet the smile I showed looked awkward.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t even imagine how I look like right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, Arisa refused to meet my gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What were you doing, Arisa?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked for the second time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You don&#8217;t have to think about it, Ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems like she had no intention to answer my question.<br />
As if hiding herself inside a shell, she hid her head with a white, fluffy hood with bunny ears attached to it.</p>
<p>(She&#8230;!)</p>
<p>&#8220;Arisa&#8230;did you do something you couldn&#8217;t tell me&#8230;? I&#8217;m disappointed in you&#8221;, I said, and with a pissed expression, I was about to leave the room.<br />
At that moment, I glanced back to look at Arisa.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-Wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>This time, Arisa caught a hold on my elbow.<br />
Just like that, I stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;what do you want, Arisa-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned around with a grin on my face while Arisa looked frustrated as she trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-wait, Ed&#8230;aren&#8217;t you misunderstanding something?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;But you see, Arisa, if you don&#8217;t want to talk about it, then we&#8217;re done talking, right?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;It doesn&#8217;t matter, right?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter? I was asking what you were doing&#8230;oh, I see. I got it now, Arisa.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook off Arisa&#8217;s arm and I was about to head for the living room once more before I felt a shock coming from my back.<br />
Arisa is hugging me on my waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll&#8230;tell you&#8230;!&#8221; she said, hiding her face by burying it on my waist.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t need to see her face to see her expression judging by how red her ears are.<br />
Her behavior is completely different than the usual Arisa who behaves like an adult.<br />
Because it&#8217;s interesting, I came up strongly on my reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoo&#8230;? Then what were you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>To what I said, Arisa stutteringly said,</p>
<p>&#8220;T-that&#8230;I was&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Arisa&#8217;s lovely lips are slowly putting together her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-In Ed&#8217;s bed&#8230;I was&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the moment she said that,</p>
<p><em>Clack</em>,</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing&#8230;Arisa-sama? And Edgar too&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The animal-eared girl that our house takes pride in appeared.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s the entrance of Ellie who went to check up on us&#8230;!</p>
<p>Seeing the face of her savior, Arisa immediately raised her face with a gasp and pattered her way over to Ellie.</p>
<p>As soon as she did, her attitude completely changed.<br />
This time, she chuckled at me as she struck a daunting pose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ed! It&#8217;s your loss!&#8221; Arisa declared as if triumphant.</p>
<p>(No this isn&#8217;t about winning or losing&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;alright, alright, that&#8217;s right~ it&#8217;s Arisa&#8217;s win~&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite being flabbergasted at Arisa&#8217;s sudden change, I remembered my goal from the beginning and decided to head for the bed.</p>
<p>(Alright, shall we continue my afternoon nap, partner?) or so I thought, but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edgar? Where are you goingg?&#8221; said Ellie, grabbing my shoulder.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t turn around&#8230;or rather, without even thinking of turning around, I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;I feel a bit under the weather so I&#8217;m thinking of taking a nap&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;re lying, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Arisa joined the fray and assisted Ellie.</p>
<p>Damn it, I can&#8217;t win a 2-vs-1&#8230;Forgive me&#8230;partner!</p>
<p>In the end, Arisa and Ellie dragged me away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright&#8221;, I&#8217;ll leave cleaning the garden to you, okay? The weeds have grown a lot, so go ahead and take care of them&#8221; said Ellie as she took off her apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, okay.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ll come and call you again, so I&#8217;ll be counting on you until then, Ed.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yeah, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arisa and Ellie said that they&#8217;ll go to the basement after this.</p>
<p>In fact, recently the two of them had been going to the basement a lot to do something sneaky.<br />
Arisa said that she found a new research material.</p>
<p>Well, I understand that they too are doing their best.</p>
<p>(&#8230;then I should also do my best in the things I can do)</p>
<p>And thus, shouldering a basket and holding a broom and a sickle to prepare to clean the garden, I exited the front door.</p>
<p>By the way, I continued cleaning the garden until Arisa and Ellie called me in for dinner, which means I worked until my surroundings turned dark&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>¹ Regarding the title, it doesn&#8217;t deviate from the usual formula. The translation could mean &#8220;XXX, but&#8230;&#8221; though it could also mean something like &#8220;About XXX&#8221; in an expression that&#8217;s similar to &#8220;So yeah, about that&#8230;&#8221;. In this case I think the latter version is more appropriate, and I&#8217;d also use this expression in the future if so.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;">Breaking the Dark of Night</h2>
<hr />
<h6 style="text-align:right;">kurokurori.wordpress.com</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flamm lost her sense of time.<br />
She didn&#8217;t know how long has she been looking down at the floor unblinking.<br />
It felt like a forever, but in reality, it might have only been several hours.<br />
The hallway where she slumped was still dark, for dawn has yet to break.<br />
Her body seeks fluid intake, yet she hadn&#8217;t even the strength to stand and head for the kitchen.</p>
<p><em>Clatter,</em></p>
<p>By then, the door behind her shook.<br />
The doorknob clattered as it twists, and the door itself hits the girl on the back several times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? The door isn&#8217;t opening&#8230;but why? It shouldn&#8217;t be locked though&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could hear Ink&#8217;s voice from inside the room.<br />
Flamm&#8217;s body twitched.<br />
Should she step away from the door?<br />
However&#8230;what&#8217;s next?<br />
There&#8217;s only one answer.<br />
Ink is, without a doubt, something similar to that monster she saw in the research facility.<br />
Then&#8230;Then—</p>
<p>&#8220;Wah, it opens&#8230;huh? Is someone there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm stepped away from the door, and while still crouching on one knee, she took out her Soul Eater.<br />
She pointed the edge of the black blade towards the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haa&#8230;haa&#8230;haa&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I could only hear breathing&#8230;Is it you, Flamm? Hey, please say something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was—Ink&#8217;s normal face.<br />
Is there a requirement for her to show this face? Or did she change it intentionally?<br />
She doesn&#8217;t know&#8230;but she can no longer believe anything.<br />
The one thing she can be sure is the sight she saw earlier&#8230;the nightmarish sight where her face turned into a vortex spewing eyeballs.<br />
Sarah had disappeared.<br />
Milkit and Eterna did not return.<br />
Countless other people had also died.<br />
All of that was because of her.</p>
<p>Flamm stood up.<br />
She put strength on both hands that gripped the hilt of her sword.<br />
She just needs to swing it down.<br />
If she does&#8230;&#8230;would it be enough to kill her?<br />
No, if she is truly similar to that <em>thing</em>, her open wounds would turn into another vortex. She would not die until her core has been destroyed.<br />
Where would her core be? Would it be in her heart? Or could it possibly be somewhere else?<br />
Flamm would need to confirm its location, so she would need to cut her up&#8230;&#8230;she&#8217;d need to&#8230;cut her&#8230;!</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re there, right? Welcome back, Flamm. I&#8217;m sorry, looks like I fell asleep last night. Maybe I sleepwalked, because when I woke up I was already on the second floor. It happens a lot in the past, you know? That&#8217;s why everyone used to scold me saying &#8220;your sleeping habits are so bad!&#8221;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;kh&#8230;fuh&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oh Flamm, are you pulling a prank on me? My ears are great so I could hear just fine, you know? Even if you&#8217;re this quiet, I can hear the sound of your heartbeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ink talked to Flamm as she always does.<br />
Does she kill her?<br />
Can she even kill this girl?<br />
Could it be that what she saw was someone who is not Ink?<br />
Yes, she was taken over.<br />
That <em>thing</em> emerged when she was asleep, intentionally showing itself to frighten Flamm.<br />
It all makes sense when she puts it like that.<br />
It makes sense—but what would it mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ink&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, Flamm called out her name.<br />
A relieved expression floats up to her face, though the next instant, her cheeks puffed with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You finally replied. I would&#8217;ve been worried if it wasn&#8217;t you, you know?&#8221; she said, showing an expression that befits a human of her age.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a person.<br />
Rather, what would she be if she&#8217;s not a person?<br />
It could stay as a monster, yet why did it turn back into a human?<br />
It must have been to corner Flamm, or to throw her off her guard.<br />
Though if that is its objective, it could just kill her directly when they spent their time living together.<br />
So why did it not do that?<br />
Why? Why? Why?<br />
Flamm didn&#8217;t know anything. No matter how long she thought about it, the answer wouldn&#8217;t come up, and thus, she couldn&#8217;t accept it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging by how you are, I guess you didn&#8217;t find the other two. It&#8217;s unfortunate, but they might come back when it gets brighter tomorrow—&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hey, Ink&#8230;did you not remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus, she asked.<br />
From the pits of despair, she reached her hands out.<br />
Ink tilts her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember what?&#8221;<br />
With her parched throat, Flamm replied; &#8220;That you&#8230;turned&#8230;into a monster&#8230;that spews eyeballs&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;What? If you&#8217;re joking, that&#8217;s too far, Flamm!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No! I&#8217;m not joking, and that wasn&#8217;t an illusion either! Until just now, you really turned into a monster in front of me! I saw it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm&#8217;s griefs echoed in the house where none other than the two are present.<br />
That voice of her faintly leaked outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;F-Flamm&#8230;That&#8217;s not&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It is possible! I didn&#8217;t mistake anything. I heard it, I smelled it, and I even remembered the temperature! You clearly weren&#8217;t human back then! You were a monster that spits out eyeballs! Hey, tell me the truth. What are you, Ink? Where did you come from!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ink probably could tell from the tone of voice that Flamm was telling the truth.<br />
Countless times has Ink whispered &#8220;that&#8217;s not it&#8230;that&#8217;s not it&#8230;&#8221; as she shook her head.<br />
Placing her hand on the wall to grasp her position, she stepped away from Flamm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a human!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words were met with an instant denial.<br />
Neither of the two are lying to each other. The two were confronting each other precisely because they both believed that they weren&#8217;t lying.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a humaann&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Those eyeballs were the one who chased after Sarah.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;N-No&#8230;I didn&#8217;t do it&#8230;!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;A lot of other people had fallen victims to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm kept spouting her thoughts with anger, while its target, Ink, could only be baffled by the sudden abhorrence from the person she believed in.<br />
Yet&#8230;the girl did not think that this hatred is irrational.<br />
She had a sliver of thought that p<em>erhaps she&#8217;s right</em>, which only made Flamm&#8217;s words hurt more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know! I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And now Milkit and Eterna is not coming back!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No! You&#8217;re wrong! You&#8217;re wrong! Why won&#8217;t you believe mee!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Obviously because I saw it! Are you telling me to believe you after showing me that!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm didn&#8217;t even want to say this if she doesn&#8217;t have to.<br />
She would believe in the girl as long as she could.<br />
She thought that this could be a place Ink could belong to, just like how Flamm and Milkit found a place they belong after their encounter with each other.<br />
However&#8230;everything&#8230;completely crumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&#8230;I&#8217;m not a monster&#8230;I&#8217;m not a monster&#8230;!&#8221;, said Ink, and she turned to climb down the stairs.</p>
<p>As she did, she tripped over and tumbled all the way to the first floor, and as her entire body throbs with pain, tears spilled from her sewn eyes.<br />
She quickly wipes her tears away with her shirt&#8230;the shirt that had a sweet scent of Flamm, the person who lent it to her.<br />
The memories of the past several days floods back to her that only made her even more sorrowful.<br />
That sorrow got her up to her feet and pushed her to run down the hallway, and despite staggering as her shoulders glanced off walls, she passed the entrance and dashed outside barefooted.<br />
The chill of the night feels like it&#8217;s telling her&#8230;that she&#8217;s in solitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flamm didn&#8217;t even try to stop the girl.<br />
Her Soul Eater dropped to the ground with a loud thud as she dropped to her knees.<br />
She shut her eyes and raised her face, and just like Ink, Flamm cried.<br />
The girl herself didn&#8217;t know for what reason does her tears spill.<br />
The combination of various laments materializes in the form of those teardrops.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kh&#8230;AAAAAAAAHHHH!! AAHH&#8230;AAAHH&#8230;AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her feelings that couldn&#8217;t go anywhere turned into a yell, and Flamm roared as if she has lost her mind.<br />
She held her head with both hands and placed her forehead on the floor, before once again, she screamed.<br />
The girl smashed her forehead on the floor repeatedly until she bleeds, punishing herself with the pain it brought&#8230;and with her withering voice&#8230;she screamed once more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Ink was about to leave, she inadvertently stopped on her tracks as she heard the voice from inside the house.<br />
She was not the only one lamenting.<br />
She was not the only one suffering.<br />
The feeling behind that scream was neither a lie nor transient; that feeling was truly based on something she experienced.<br />
In other words, Flamm was telling the truth.<br />
It was not a dream.<br />
Ink was convinced&#8230;that Flamm had truly saw her turn into a monster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fu&#8230;guh&#8230;uh&#8230;uu&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ink bit her lip, and she weeps as her shoulders tremble.<br />
She wanted to believe that it was not possible.<br />
Yet at the same time, she understood that the facility she was raised in was not normal.<br />
The girl didn&#8217;t know what they have done with her or for what reason had she been raised there.<br />
All because she was an ostracized, good-for-nothing.<br />
Though if she knew that this would happen, she wouldn&#8217;t have ran away.<br />
She would continue to live like a clueless livestock in a small garden.<br />
She wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the chance of obtaining the happiness of an ordinary person, but at the very least, she wouldn&#8217;t have to go through this suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fla—MMPH!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just when she was about to take the first step back into the house, someone bound her hands behind her back and covered her mouth.<br />
Judging by the size of the hand and the strength of the person, it was likely to be a man.<br />
Despite her struggle and resistance, it doesn&#8217;t look like she could break free, though when the hand that covers her mouth loosened, the girl screamed desperately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flamm heard Ink&#8217;s scream as she lay dazed with her forehead on the floor.<br />
Her scream was immediately interrupted, but it was definitely her scream.<br />
Is she perhaps being attacked by someone?</p>
<p><em>I have to save her</em>, she thought on reflex and immediately stood up.<br />
However, she stopped herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haa&#8230;ah&#8230;what..what would I do after saving her&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>What would she do after she had driven the girl out as if she&#8217;s a monster?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;aah,&#8221;</p>
<p>The fake &#8220;justice&#8221; in her heart lifts her head.<br />
That&#8217;s the type of person she is.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is she doing, playing hero even when Milkit is not around?<br />
Flamm, too, didn&#8217;t understand herself.<br />
However, she doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to hold herself back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still&#8230;have to save her&#8230;even though I know I&#8217;ll regret it&#8230;!&#8221; she thought, leaving behind her reasons.</p>
<p>This means she must not think of what happens after.<br />
She just needs to think about it when she gets there.<br />
For now, she needs to save Ink so that she can have a future where she can choose whether to let her live or kill her.</p>
<p>Flamm descends the stairs as her Soul Eater disperses into thin air and returned to being a seal on her palm.<br />
The moment she reached the hallway on the first floor, she ran straight outside as fast as she could.<br />
As she took a leap outside, light particles converged on her feet, and the Epic leather boots equips itself,<br />
She landed sliding, and immediately, she looked around her.<br />
Ink was—there, with her arms bound on her back by a man with a large build.</p>
<p>&#8220;INK!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Whoops, there she comes, huh.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Dain&#8230;! What are you doing here!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What? Isn&#8217;t it obvious that I&#8217;m here to find this runaway guinea pig? I felt that she might be here and turns out I&#8217;m right. Smart, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221; Dain said.</p>
<p>He tightens his grip on Ink who suffers as she writhed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go of Ink!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Shit, I&#8217;ve got my own shit to deal with too y&#8217;know? &#8216;sides, this runt came out running herself. Did&#8217;ya have a fight or somethin&#8217;? Can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t feel ya. I heard ya&#8217; sayin &#8220;YOU MONSTER&#8221; and shit. Poor runt. It&#8217;s true though, HYAHAHAHAHA!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You&#8230;YOU BASTARDD!!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ooh, scary. Sorry that I spit facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite what he said, Dain still looks as easygoing as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ey, Flamm, do you know why this brat is called a useless failiure?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, and I don&#8217;t want to know!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Welp, just listen for a tick, will ya. This girl doesn&#8217;t know as much as you do that she&#8217;s a murderous monster. You know why?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mmmm&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Murderous monster.<br />
Hearing those words, Ink responded as she faced down.<br />
She must not have wanted to know.<br />
Yet Dain didn&#8217;t pay any attention to her&#8230;no, he rather looked like he&#8217;s enjoying himself as he started telling the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because the Origin&#8217;s power can only manifest itself if she&#8217;s in a state of &#8220;deep sleep&#8221;.  Origin&#8217;s power can only control over her body if she&#8217;s unconscious. Even when she&#8217;s livin&#8217; with ya, those gentle eyeballs they call automatic defense function spat out by that disgustin&#8217; face only functions when every one of ya was sleepin&#8217;. Funny ain&#8217;t it? The one creating the things that corners yer friend and even that slave yer protecting is right under yer nose the entire time! AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!<br />
&#8220;You&#8230;you knew about Milkit and Eterna!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;<em>Knew</em>? I was the one who tricked them to have the eyes on their tail. They&#8217;ve probably turned into those disgusting pile of meat right about now!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;—kh! I&#8217;ll kill you&#8230;I&#8217;LL DEFINITELY KILL YOUUUU!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm took out her sword and charged at Dain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa there, I have a duty to send this runaway monster back. I&#8217;ll leave the distractions to these guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right as Dain said his mark, several of his men hiding nearby revealed themselves.<br />
Their eyes are all dead.<br />
It&#8217;s likely that the church had done something to them.<br />
How pitiful.<br />
Even though they were Dain&#8217;s allies that had believed in him for such a long time, their consciousness had been taken away as they waited for church service, and now they&#8217;re left being treated as a tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;The employer said to not kill Flamm Apricot&#8230;welp, no matter, I myself want to kill you, but let me give you a warning.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;warning?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yeap, I&#8217;m just being kind to ya. Anyways, don&#8217;t you lay your hands on those guys. Run, and don&#8217;t even think of going after me. Those guys are officially church members.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Are you trying to beg for your life!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hahahah! Of course not! I&#8217;m saying this with you in mind, ya&#8217; know? I could control myself as long as I see those eyes of yours. Welp, do your best surviving!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mmmpphh!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving those words behind, Dain took Ink and ran away.<br />
The girl in question stretched her hand out towards Flamm as if she&#8217;s begging to be saved.</p>
<p>&#8220;IINNNKKK!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm yelled the girl&#8217;s name and stepped forward, but Dain&#8217;s subordinates stood in her way.<br />
About 10 men surrounded Flamm, each holding various close-combat weapons like shortswords, spears and blunt weapons.<br />
There are even some men wielding bows, bowguns and slings standing further away and on the rooftops.<br />
One could consider it overkill considering their opponent is a lone girl.</p>
<p>Flamm scanned one of the man nearby to confirm their abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">——————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span class="st">Gauguin </span>Torres</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Attribute: <span style="color:#ff0000;">Fire</span></em><br />
<em>Strength: <strong>611</strong></em><br />
<em>Intelligence: <strong>422</strong></em><br />
<em>Endurance: <strong>580</strong></em><br />
<em>Agility: <strong>412</strong></em><br />
<em>Intuition: <strong>457</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">——————————————————————————</p>
<p>His total number is 2,482, a strong C-rank.<br />
He&#8217;s a quite capable adventurer; perhaps he&#8217;s the leading figure of the group.<br />
Just to be safe, she decided to scan another man.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">——————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span class="st">Gauguin </span>Torres</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Attribute: <span style="color:#ff0000;">Fire</span></em><br />
<em>Strength: <strong>611</strong></em><br />
<em>Intelligence: <strong>422</strong></em><br />
<em>Endurance: <strong>580</strong></em><br />
<em>Agility: <strong>412</strong></em><br />
<em>Intuition: <strong>457</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">——————————————————————————</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230;the exact same!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is that even possible?<br />
The same given and family name aside, is it possible that they have the same value on their statuses?<br />
She tried scanning the person next to him, and—</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">——————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span class="st">Gauguin </span>Torres</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Attribute: <span style="color:#ff0000;">Fire</span></em><br />
<em>Strength: <strong>611</strong></em><br />
<em>Intelligence: <strong>422</strong></em><br />

<em>Agility: <strong>412</strong></em><br />
<em>Intuition: <strong>457</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">——————————————————————————</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also shows the same result.<br />
This means that despite their difference in appearances, Dain&#8217;s subordinates that surround her all had the same strength.<br />
Seeing this blatant show, Flamm is not even surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must have also been the church&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>This iis definitely the power of those &#8220;cores&#8221;.<br />
Dain sold his friends so he could be one of the church members.<br />
She could tell by looking that these guys have probably lost their minds.<br />
As if there are people who wishes to be like this.</p>
<p>Flam gnashed her teeth.<br />
She wouldn&#8217;t say that these people are innocent.<br />
However, these guys all look up to Dain in one way or another.<br />
And he betrayed them to save himself&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything about him&#8230;is unforgivable&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She empowered herself with her anger and leaped forward to charge at the men.<br />
This is the first time for her to fight a large number of people.<br />
Her opponents are adventurers that had slightly lower status than hers, and if she considers their number, there&#8217;s no way she could win.<br />
She had to use all of her advantages to see a chance of victory, be it her regenerative power or her <em>Reverse </em>spell.<br />
As a start, she needs to whittle down the enemies to take away their superior number.</p>
<p><em>Fwish!</em></p>
<p>Flamm swung her Soul Eater horizontally, but the men who were in range of her blade avoided by leaping away.<br />
The moment Flamm swung her sword, she could hear a whistling sound coming from above.<br />
She saw an arrow on the edge of her field of vision, aimed at her feet.<br />
She charged her mana, and when she was hit with a sharp pain,</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Reversal!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>She casted her spell.<br />
As a result, the arrow changed its direction and shoots back towards its owner, but the man twists his body and evaded.<br />
Flamm clicked her tongue instinctively.<br />
She could&#8217;ve finished one off just like that, but it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>She had known that the men would attack her like this, that&#8217;s why she could cast her <em>Reversal</em> spell.<br />
If that was a surprise attack, she wouldn&#8217;t have managed to pull it off.</p>
<p>She steeled herself again immediately afterwards.<br />
The moment the man she slashed at retreated, another man wielding a spear in front of him thrusts his weapon towards her body.<br />
With a stab, Flamm purposely took on the hit.<br />
There&#8217;s only one way for her to overcome his advantage of the long reach of his weapon, so she grit her teeth and forcibly pushed forward.<br />
The sharp end of the spear buries itself into her shoulder.<br />
Her blood spews, and the heated feel from the stabbing brought her severe pain.<br />
The girl showed a pained expression for a split second, but then she exhaled and suppressed her feelings.<br />
To make sure that the man won&#8217;t take the spear back easily, she held onto the spearhandle and robbed the man of his weapon.<br />
She confirmed that the man had released the spear, she pulled it out from her shoulder and threw it on the ground.<br />
At the same time, two men wielding a sword each charged in from both sides, and another man wielding a spear is closing in from behind.<br />
She had no choice but to go forward.<br />
Flamm struggled through the flurry of blades attacking her and swung her sword towards the unarmed man.<br />
Flamm thought that her rush was imperfect, so the man must be able to dodge this strike—but,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fu&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man charged in, and with a twist of his fist, he hit Flamm on her abdomen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ga&#8230;ha&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The impact shook her internal organs, expelling all the air she had in her lungs.<br />
His movement is too skillful&#8230;so his primary weapon wasn&#8217;t a spear?<br />
No, his movement when using the spear wasn&#8217;t one you could call amateurish either.<br />
He&#8217;s good at using the spear and his fists&#8230;would a man that skilled be content by being Dain&#8217;s underling?<br />
A single possibility appears on Flamm&#8217;s mind.<br />
Is it possible that these guys also shared not only their abilities but their skills as well?</p>
<p>As she staggered, Flamm was impaled from behind.<br />
The man quickly pulled out the spear and unleashed another attack immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;A&#8230;guh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, the man on her right charged in, aiming for an attack to her neck.<br />
Flamm defended herself with her right arm, but that ended up with her right arm being cut off instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;giiiiihhh&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, an arrow whistled in from her front, burying itself into her shoulders.<br />
A fireball was shot from the roof to her left, and as it explodes on her left leg, it gouged her flesh and caused her to tumble to the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;U&#8230;&#8230;gu&#8230;aah&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Every parts of her body is hurting and it robbed her of her freedom of movement.<br />
The difference of strength between them is too overwhelming.<br />
Fighting this many people in such an open space is reckless, and it was near impossible for her to make her way to an alleyway.<br />
Prioritizing ease of movement, the collapsed girl removed her Soul Eater.<br />
With her power, she made a cartwheel and rolled behind the man wielding a sword.</p>
<p>&#8220;AAAAHH!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Afterwards, she swung her hand as she instantly rematerialize her Soul Eater, aiming to cut the man&#8217;s neck.<br />
<em>Fwish!<br />
</em>However, even without looking back, the man ducked down and evaded that strike.</p>
<p>—<em>No way</em>.</p>
<p>Flamm&#8217;s eyes widened.<br />
Did he have eyes on the back of his head? She could&#8217;ve had him.<br />
&#8230;maybe there&#8217;s another thing that the men shared.<br />
Perhaps not only that they shared their skills and abilities&#8230;they also shared their five senses.<br />
Otherwise, there were no other way the man could&#8217;ve evaded that attack.<br />
In the moment of her surprise, more blades, spears, arrows and spells assaulted her.<br />
Even if she rolls away to evade the attacks, the intensity of their attacks persist.</p>
<p>She remembered what Dain told her, which pissed her off further.<br />
She didn&#8217;t want to admit that she had to follow his warning.<br />
However, she had no choice but to run away.</p>
<p>Pitching forward as if she&#8217;s falling over, she rushed to the entrance of the nearest alleyway.<br />
She still felt pain despite her injuries being healed already, but it wasn&#8217;t so bad that she couldn&#8217;t move.<br />
The men chased after her.<br />
However, the men would have difficulties chasing after her, and the narrow alleyway can make a situation where they would have to fight Flamm one-on-one.<br />
Despite stumbling over and over, Flamm desperately ran.<br />
Just a bit more&#8230;just a bit more and she&#8217;ll get there.<br />
That&#8217;s&#8230;what she thought.<br />
Two fireballs grazed her on both sides, hitting the outer walls of the houses and exploded.</p>
<p>The walls collapse and the rubble blocked her way.<br />
She probably could climb over the rubble, but with this many people chasing after her, they would definitely not let her do so unscathed.<br />
Flamm impatiently turned around, but that instant, arrows pierced her stomach and her thighs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha&#8230;AAAAAHHH!!&#8221;</p>
<p>She immediately pulled them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah&#8230;hah&#8230;hah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened from the pain, and her breathing turned rugged.<br />
More arrows and spell bolts were fired at her without delay, and a man wielding a one-handed mace approached her as he dodged the incoming projectiles.<br />
Flamm desperately swings her Soul Eater.<br />
Her strikes were dodged without question, and the man closed his distance and raised the lump of metal at her.<br />
If she were to counterattack in an obvious way, all the men would know about it due to their shared senses and they would make a move to avoid it.<br />
There&#8217;s no other choice but to take on their attacks.</p>
<p>However, Flamm smiled.<br />
She focuses her mana to her feet and sent it to the stone pavement that spans several dozens of centimeters around her through the tip of her toes.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Reversal!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment she cast her spell, the pavement turned inside-out.<br />
As he heard a dull sound, the legs of the man in front of her turned into an angle it&#8217;s not supposed to go as they got caught under the stone.<br />
Losing his balance, his body lurched forward.<br />
With this, there&#8217;s no way for him to dodge no matter how many angles he could see himself in.</p>
<p>&#8220;SOORYAAA!&#8221;</p>
<p>She landed a strike with her all as she raised a shout, cleaving the defenseless man from his right shoulder down to his left flank, and that instant, the cross section froze immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one!&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a clear difference in numbers between her and her enemies, but a kill is a kill, and the intensity of the enemy&#8217;s attack would be reduced regardless.</p>
<p>Despite seeing their ally slain, the rest of the men didn&#8217;t react.<br />
They truly has lost their mind.<br />
They had consolidated their consciousness, turning into something that couldn&#8217;t be called human.<br />
They&#8217;re nothing but dolls that can only serve Dain&#8217;s command.<br />
Though, perhaps because of that, Flamm didn&#8217;t feel the guilt of killing a human.</p>
<p>Flamm avoided a spell bolt aimed at her leg and pointed the tip of her blade at the men.<br />
Now that she had used her trick, it would be difficult for them to fall for another one.<br />
As she thought about how to deal with the second enemy, she heard the sound of something dropping.<br />
Glancing to the side where she heard the sound, she saw&#8230;eyeballs dropping.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be fine if there was only one of them&#8230;but following that, countless spheres kept dropping like a squall.<br />
Not only were they coming from above, the eyeballs are flooding in from the gutters, from behind her and even from where the men are charging at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that&#8230;what he meant&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what Dain was warning her about.<br />
Flamm finally understood what he meant when he said &#8220;<em>don&#8217;t lay your hands on these men. Run.</em>&#8221;<br />
Ink is not aware that she kills people.<br />
She&#8217;s not aware that she is a monster.<br />
This means that everything has nothing to do with will; the power she has are activated spontaneously.<br />
It&#8217;s an automated defense.<br />
It attacks those who are involved with the church&#8230;no, considering that Sarah and the knights are involved, that was not it.<br />
It&#8217;s likely an uncontrollable defense system that tried to protect the confidential information regarding the experiments. That was the true nature of those disgusting eyeballs that Ink produces.</p>
<p>Flamm finally saw the last thing those poor people saw at the end of their life.<br />
She instinctively jumped away to distance herself, yet she was too late. The eyeballs that had glued itself to her boots invaded her body.<br />
There were no pain—only disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;HII&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm&#8217;s body froze.<br />
The eyeballs crawled up into her shin, and after it went into her leg, her boot swells as another foot grew out from her shin.</p>
<p>&#8220;T-this&#8230;guh&#8230;disgusting&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps feeling as if the two feet are stacked on top of each other, Flamm couldn&#8217;t properly manage the strength of her leg and maintain a steady footing.<br />
At that moment, a man wielding a short sword charged in on her, aiming straight for her heart.<br />
Flamm promptly took the hit with her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ack&#8230;guh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The blade pierced through her palm.<br />
The man was about to pull his sword back to unleash another attack, but Flamm grabbed the sword by its hilt and prevented him from doing so.<br />
The physical strength of the two are about even, so considering Flamm&#8217;s injury, she might have been in a disadvantage, but Flamm kicked the man&#8217;s leg and ruined his posture, causing him to fall over to the sea of eyeballs.</p>
<p>Like a bunch of spiders, the eyeballs scattered to avoid the falling man.<br />
It seems like it had the function to not injure its allies.<br />
However, those that had no time to avoid the man ended up touching him, and that instant, the eyeballs entered his body, and the man grew another arm and leg.<br />
Perhaps because his internal organs also multiplied, his body part that touched the ground swells in a warp shape.</p>
<p>The man writhed as he tried to get up, but unable to properly use his limbs, he ended up only wriggling on the ground like a maggot.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;two!&#8221; she declared to encourage herself.</p>
<p>However, there are still a lot of enemies she had to face.<br />
Her movement speed dropped because she had another foot, but she could still avoid the arrows and spells coming her way by a hair&#8217;s breadth.<br />
She turned some of them back with <em>Reversal</em>, but because of the enemy&#8217;s shared senses, she couldn&#8217;t hit them back.</p>
<p>Because of the eyeballs, her plan of fighting the enemy little by little has been thrown out the window.<br />
Are there any place that could be advantageous for her?<br />
Flamm turned away from the men and ran to look for advantages, but because of her other foot, she couldn&#8217;t run as fast as she usually could.<br />
With this much people she had to go against, it definitely would be a fight of attrition.</p>
<p>The growth of her foot is not considered an &#8220;injury&#8221;, which means that the Soul Eater is not going to regenerate it.<br />
That&#8217;s why&#8230;the girl stabbed the Soul Eater to the ground and sent a kick towards it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kkh&#8230;GAAAAAHHH&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Slice.<br />
</em>Along with Flamm&#8217;s voice of anguish, she cut her foot off.<br />
Losing her foot, Flamm advanced forward using her sword as a cane.<br />
If she stops, she&#8217;ll fall victim to those eyeballs.<br />
She could only advance this slowly until she regenerates her foot back, but it&#8217;s still better than having to drag another foot with her.</p>
<p>She finally regenerated to full health before the men could catch up on her.<br />
Due to the increased agility from her boots, Flamm could run away from the men.<br />
By then, she saw some knights in front of her.<br />
There were 5 of them.<br />
Dain&#8217;s subordinates aside, she couldn&#8217;t let them get swallowed up by those eyeballs, thus Flamm ran up to the plate armor-clad men to warn them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, this place is dangerous&#8230;so&#8230;you should&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the knights suddenly drew their swords all at the same time, the well-polished golden blade reflects the streetlight.</p>
<p>Flamm scans the men, and she found that although they were different than Dain&#8217;s underlings, all five of them had the exact same status as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;No way&#8230;from both sides!?&#8221;</p>
<p>The church were thorough.<br />
It was unclear if they&#8217;re going to capture her or kill her; what is clear is that they are not going to run away from Flamm.<br />
Gripping on her Soul Eater, Flamm looked to all sides where the enemies surround her.<br />
Adventurers, Knights, Eyeballs.<br />
There were too many of them. How could she cut her way through them all?<br />
Her hand trembles, and the tip of her blade wavered.<br />
The feeling of solitude emphasized her fear.<br />
She had always fought by thinking she could support Milkit, but the girl is nowhere to be found.<br />
At that moment, there were no one she has to protect, nor there is anyone waiting for her to return.<br />
Her heart cracks, her feet froze.<br />
Her end&#8230;is approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to die&#8230;I&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to die&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>She only had whatever&#8217;s left of her courage; the backwards-thinking willpower of not wanting to accept death.<br />
In other words, if either of her enemies would stop in their tracks by just one step, she would have the chance to run away.</p>
<p>There are less knights than there are adventurers, so Flamm pointed her blade at the knights and lifts it high.<br />
She concentrated, consuming the power circulating in her body and transforming them to Prana.<br />
She transfers the energy dwelling within her like water to her arms and sent them straight into her sword.</p>
<p>The <em>Prana Slash.</em></p>
<p>Not the <em>Imitation</em>, but the real one.<br />
If she could unleash that&#8230;no, even if she could unleash that, she still wouldn&#8217;t be able to take down all of the knights.<br />
Could she unleash it in several succession? No, she&#8217;s not that skillful to be able to do such feat.<br />
In the first place, she wasn&#8217;t even sure if she could unleash one properly.<br />
Her palm sweats, and her Prana fades along with her determination.<br />
<em>No, don&#8217;t be pessimistic&#8230;don&#8217;t give up&#8230;you won&#8217;t know until you try&#8230;! </em>Flamm told herself.</p>
<p>That would probably the last thing she could tell herself.<br />
She&#8217;s running out of time; the adventurers would catch up to her soon, and the eyeballs will probably surround her in no time.<br />
If the Knights properly joins the fray, there would be no way for her to even pull through their attacks.<br />
Thus, despite knowing its futility, she believed in a miracle and wagered her life in this one attack&#8230;!</p>
<p>&#8220;Flamm! Slam your Prana to the ground!&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the voice of a brave hero echoed in the capital filled with despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;HAAAAAAAAAHH!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm raised her voice and slammed her Soul Eater to the ground.<br />
That moment, the Prana violently explodes.<br />
The power of the explosion created a shockwave filled with countless blades that assaults the knights.<br />
The men defended themselves with their shields, yet the power went through the cracks of their armor, tearing them to pieces.</p>
<p><em>Cavalier Arts—Prana Storm.</em></p>
<p>Instead of unleashing the refined Prana as a blade, this technique shoots them to her front, creating an extensive destructive power.<br />
It was something that requires more Prana than the <em>Prana Slash,</em> but the cornered girl had already reached a level where she could unleash it.</p>
<p>The source of the voice jumped down from a nearby rooftop to Flamm&#8217;s side.<br />
As he landed, the man wearing a jet black heavy armor crushed the stone pavement under him.<br />
He stood up as he drew his greatsword and swung it towards the adventurers and eyeballs that approached from behind Flamm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmph!!&#8221;</p>
<p>He unleashed colossal amount of Prana, shaving away not only the ground, but also the walls of nearby buildings, while all that lives within range were obliterated.<br />
More eyeballs keep appearing from other places, but the adventurers took caution and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadio-san&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm called to the man with her voice wavering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heads up, Flamm. They&#8217;re still coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>His hoarse voice was impactful but there was a kind tone to it, and that voice was enough to lift up Flamm&#8217;s spirit who was sinking in solitude.</p>
<p>As he said, the fight is not over yet.<br />
Flamm was happy for their reunion, but she could save that for later.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamm wipes her tears away and looked directly ahead towards some more knights that just appeared.<br />
The two gripped their greatswords, and with their backs against each other,</p>
<p>&#8220;OOOOOHHH!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;HAAAAAAAAAA!!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dashed forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://kurokurori.wordpress.com/2019/11/12/apricot-chapter-21/">&lt; Chapter 21</a>     <a href="https://kurokurori.wordpress.com/2019/04/26/%e3%80%8cdo-you-think-someone-like-you-can-defeat-the-demon-king%e3%80%8d-a-k-a-apricot/">&lt;TOC&gt;</a>     Chapter 23 &gt;</p>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>TLN:</strong></em></p>
<p>Honestly when Flamm saw gashes on the wall where Sarah went missing I really thought it was Neigass, but hey, the longer you haven&#8217;t seen someone, the better the reunion.<br />
Also it would probably be kind of unthinkable for a demon such as Neigass to be strolling around the capital.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed the chapter, and have a good day.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993366;">Extremely Small Fry</span></h2>
<hr />
<h6 style="text-align:right;">kurokurori.wordpress.com</h6>
<p>&#8220;Because Kuon is a foreign object in that world, reincarnation is impossible&#8230;. However, because there&#8217;s this 【Majikoi】 thing exists and this world is now connected to it through that, Kuon took on someone&#8217;s body there and I guess he&#8217;s trying to take Finne along with Eeva&#8217;s soul into that world.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;W-W-W-W-Wait a moment! There&#8217;s too much information for me to handle!&#8221;<br />
Finne swiftly stopped Lilena&#8217;s words, which still seem to have a lot more to explain.</p>
<p>Finne slowly asked the goddess, whose head is tilted and giving a dumbfounded look.<br />
&#8220;Uhmm, first of all, I&#8217;m the first woman, Eeva?&#8217;s reincarnation? Was it?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s why I tried to possess Miss Liselotte, who was jealous of you as a rival.&#8221;<br />
Is that the prerequisite? Finne seemed angry at the words from the goddess, but she managed to keep asking questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what do you mean by taking me to Coebayashay&#8217;s world?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is. Kuon will pull your soul out of your body, bring it to that world, toss it into a fresh corpse or a human whose soul is dead and become lovers, is what I think he will do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;A fresh corpse or a dead soul&#8230; that&#8217;s really disturbing, though&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s what Kuon will prepare for Finne to &#8216;possess&#8217;, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Finne&#8217;s body will be left in this world in a state of whether she would be dead or semi-dead if her soul got pulled out.<br />
Finne, whose plan had been arbitrarily constructed, turned pale and fell one step back.<br />
Both Liese and Baldur caught and hugged her, and the two glared at the Goddess Lilena.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m very sorry&#8230;!&#8221;<br />
Lilena bowed to Liselotte.<br />
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to apologize for. I knew I was targeted because of my ugly heart. But what I&#8217;m angry with is your foolish half who is trying to get the love from the innocent Finne to the point of harming someone in that world&#8230;!!&#8221;<br />
Lilena, who is scolded by Liselotte, dug her forehead even deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly! Both I as well as Kuon are stupid to the core! However, Miss Liselotte doesn&#8217;t have an ugly heart! Please let me refute just this one because it was the one that connected me and the one that has saved me!!&#8221;<br />
Lilena shouted loudly and desperately, leaving Liselotte closing her mouth as if she was overawed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, my Liselotte is a very nice girl that everyone loves, but what do you mean by saved&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;<br />
As her replacement, I stepped a step forward and asked so, the Goddess Lilena spoke while lowering her head.<br />
&#8220;In the beginning, I thought that Miss Liselotte was the same as me. In addition, she&#8217;s strong and also physically trained, so I thought she&#8217;s a good prey and tried to take her. However, under the protection of Miss Coebayashay and Mr. Endow, loved by Mr. Siegward, Miss Liselotte herself has a strong and noble heart, and her brilliant and shining love is also beautiful&#8230;, it was, completely different from me.&#8221;<br />
Liselotte turned red and looked down while<span style="color:var(--color-text);"> listening to the goddess who slowly put her words. Though, everyone on the spot is looking at her with gentle eyes.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While interacting with Miss Liselotte, I also remembered my love for Kuon and the love for this world that I had created. Hence, I was able to return to the white me.<br />
When I was the ancient witch, I was black and only consumed dark things, such as &#8220;Thanksgiving, but there&#8217;s no last dance partner&#8221;, &#8220;Riajuu go explode&#8221;, or &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare be festive, society&#8221;. That&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t gather any power as I couldn&#8217;t do it at all.<br />
But the white me has the warm power from everyone who worshiped Lilena even when I was the ancient witch, the prayers that everyone dedicated for their gratitude, the hope that was conveyed, love, wish, happiness, those lots of white things told me a lot…<br />
Not only just my power which is certain to recover, my body got recovered as well, please look at this body! There&#8217;s even legs!<br />
The Goddess of Creation, Lilena, is completely resurrected here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying so, she stood up bright and beautiful to the point of being divine.<br />
The platinum hair which extend to the lower part of the waist, slender limbs, and even the dust that had adhered due to her prostrating, seemed to emit light.<br />
&#8220;Resurrection of the Goddess Lilena&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Al who is a priest, muttered so deeply that his eyes were moistened, but for the goddess, her forehead, her palms and knees, as well as her hair were covered with soil.<br />
It&#8217;s wonderful to say that the goddess, Lilena has regained her power so that she can see through everything in here and that world, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is thanks to Miss Liselotte! Thank you!! So, uhh, umm&#8230; Could the temple please give some kind of medal of honour to Miss Liselotte in exchange for me?&#8221;<br />
However, seeing Lilena&#8217;s expression when asking Al while rubbing her hands along with her speech and conduct from before, makes her look exactly like a small fry.<br />
&#8230;&#8230;is she the real one?</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! She naturally has the qualification of a saint&#8230; and, there might be some interruption from another kingdom, so get married as soon as possible, will you?<br />
Let&#8217;s see, at the time of the ceremony, Goddess Lilena will appear with a bang, bless your marriage and announced that she&#8217;s a saint. It will be some kind of proclamation so that plan could work.&#8221;<br />
Al, however, told Lilena pliantly with a carefree attitude in front of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;M-Married!? What are you talking about suddenly!?&#8221;<br />
Liese shouted at Al with a red face.<br />
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m serious. I mean, Liselotte-chan is the Marquis&#8217; daughter, right? You&#8217;re your papa&#8217;s general too, right? You got the training to become a queen since childhood and moreover, you&#8217;re also beautiful, right? And not just that, you&#8217;re acknowledged to be a saint as you have resurrected Goddess Lilena as well, so other kingdoms will obviously want to have you, you know?<br />
It might even occur a war between kingdoms just for taking you.<br />
That&#8217;s why, quickly get married to Sieg. If we had a marriage blessed by the Goddess, as one would expect, there can be no one who would want to interrupt with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;Me too! I and Endo will bless their marriage!!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Liese&#8217;s marriage partner, I&#8217;m bewildered with what Al had nonchalantly said and the cheerful words from Coebayashay as well. Please hold on a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I don&#8217;t need to be a saint!! I don&#8217;t look like a saint to begin with&#8230; if it&#8217;s from the temple or the likes, then won&#8217;t it just be fine to honor Arthur Richter who&#8217;s a priest in my replacement?”<br />
&#8220;Nononono, that&#8217;s impossible, a priest can&#8217;t lieee. I can&#8217;t even do nothing when Goddess Lilena is already resurrected like this. There are temples outside our kingdom as well, and I don&#8217;t think I can hide it for so looong.<br />
I mean, look, if you become a saint and have the Goddess bless your marriage at the same time, won&#8217;t your status as a queen be even more solid? You will almost have zero worry about being cheated, you know? Moreover, in diplomatic terms, it will be very useful for a queen to be recognized as a saint and good for the kingdom, right? That&#8217;s why, just be obedient and accept it, or rather, if you don&#8217;t accept it, I might be beaten up in the temple&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Even if you say something like that, the time for His Highness&#8217;s marriage depends on the circumstances of the kingdom and, above all, his own will&#8230;.!&#8221;<br />
Liese and Al were in a discussion, and I have no idea when to insert my opinion here. Please, hold on for a moment, I also have something called a plan&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eeh? Those kind of things depends on you, though? or rather, do you not want to marry Sieg, Liselotte-chan?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;, umm&#8230; I want&#8230; but&#8230;&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;m glad. I purposely made a quick footstep after Liselotte looked down with a bright red face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liese.&#8221;<br />
When I called her name, Liselotte turned to me with a surprised look.<br />
I kneeled in front of her and gently took her left hand.<br />
&#8220;Looking like this and propose is somewhat sloven, but&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Saying so, I smiled and Liese trembled while having wet eyes.<br />
&#8220;I will graduate from this school but you will still have two more years being here and it can&#8217;t be helped that we will have an increased amount of time away from each other. So I&#8217;m honestly uneasy. I know that you&#8217;re not a person that could cheat, but I can&#8217;t stop the others from thinking about you.<br />
I want to show the public that you are officially mine. I want to live in the same house as you and spend some time together.</p>
<p>Therefore, will you marry me as soon as I graduate?&#8221;<br />
Saying so, I put out a ring from my pocket. The moment I tried to put it on her left ring finger, I realized that my hand was shaking unavoidably and I couldn&#8217;t do it. This is really uncool.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;that&#8217;s what I wanted to tell you. My father, my mother, the Riefenstahl couple, and even my father&#8217;s aide had talked about this since a while back.<br />
Though, I&#8230; wasn&#8217;t going to say it here and in such a way, you see&#8230;&#8221;<br />
I have said everything that I wanted to say while being most likely uncool, and Liselotte nimbly turned to her father, the Marquis.<br />
&#8220;Yeah. I had heard that His Highness wants to propose before he graduated and arrange the ceremony next fall, but&#8230; somehow, could you, make it until spring instead&#8230;?&#8221;<br />
Saying so, her father gave a weak smile while his face was looking seemingly lonely and could cry at any moment.</p>
<p>The Riefenstahl father and daughter stared at each other with complex expressions. There&#8217;s probably lots of emotions filled inside their purple crystal eyes, both of which are moistened with tears.<br />
Soon enough, the father slowly nodded once in silence.<br />
&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Liselotte turned her eyes away from her father to avoid crying and slowly and straightly faced me.</p>
<p>&#8220;……Is it, okay?&#8221;<br />
I finally put the ring on her fingertip with my hand that has stopped quivering.<br />
&#8220;……I&#8217;m&#8230; happy.&#8221;<br />
Saying so, Liese then put her right hand on my hand to support me, and I put the ring on her.</p>
<p>*PIKA!!*</p>
<p>At that moment, the Goddess, Lilena glowed.<br />
&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m, umm&#8230;, because I had received my power from Miss Liselotte, I have to link with her by all means, or rather, thank you for another good quality power, or rather, it&#8217;s the Goddess nature to glow when she had been given power, or rather, umm&#8230;, I-I didn&#8217;t plan to get in the way&#8230;&#8221;<br />
The goddess then slowly kneeled and returned to her prostrate (default) position.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">&#8220;&#8230;Read the mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment the goddess of the other world (Coebayashay) reprimanded her with a very low angry voice, this world goddess (Lilena) slammed her forehead onto the ground.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">==================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ooh, aren&#8217;t these great enhancements? It doesn&#8217;t matter if I don&#8217;t have it, though with this, it will save my time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hannes: &#8220;So he isn&#8217;t your comrade?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myra: &#8220;&#8230;Either way, he&#8217;s an enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I threw a poison needle while she aimed her bow towards Yuu-san. Because there are a lot enemies for one person, why don&#8217;t I let her eat one of my new poison, yes?</p>
<p>I charged in while continuing to throw the needles. The vanguard immediately went forward and the rear-guard stepped back, but that doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>A longsword and an axe are approaching from both sides. I dodged the waving longsword, lifted up the axe from below with the hilt of my dagger, slipped through from their side, and swung my dagger towards the spear userーーーWhile he&#8217;s in his defensive position, I threw iron scraps at the priest girl and removed her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;Shi-!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The axe user and the swordsman attacked from behind immediately after the surprised spear user rolled over to another spot. I threw another needle again from the flank to prevent an attack towards Yuu-sanーーーNaturally this time it was prevented with a metallic sound, but it&#8217;s okay as the purpose was to stop the attack.</p>
<p>I ignored the axe user who takes more time to re-establish his axe because it&#8217;s heavier than the others, thrust my dagger at the swordsman and pierced through with my dominant hand. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Kote&#8221; in Kendo, you see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryne: &#8220;Guh!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dropping his longsword, the head of the swordsman went flying.</p>
<p>I then returned to my initial position and cast both 《Holy Wall》 and 《Wind Wall》.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleanor: &#8220;《Exploding Flame》!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a pause, I blocked the magic that was released by the magician and the axe user once again tried to attackーーー</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hannes: &#8220;You think I will let you get me once again!?! 《Earth Rhythm》!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>――――The ground radiates with intense effect from the axe that was slammed into the ground, elevated me, and the spear user approaches the place where he could get my footing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;《Three-stranded Whirlwind》!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After having Azabu-san and Inoue-san pulled me, I avoided it backwards and threw several iron scraps and poison needles towards the rear guard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleanor: &#8220;《Firewall》!”</p>
<p>Myra: &#8220;《Thundercloud Arrow》!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They defended it with magic and furthermore tried to counterattack. However, I also shot it down 《Four Exploding Blades》, repelled the approaching axe, drove away the spear, and thrust my dagger into the axe user&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hannes: &#8220;Gafuh?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like so, I put explosive balls inside the headless body and threw it away to the rear guard. Whether it will explode many times or not even explode at all, it will still keep them restrained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;Fuh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lowered my head and dodged the attack from the spear user who has recovered and bashed him with the hilt of my dagger from the side to make him lose his position.</p>
<p>I released a roundhouse kick immediately from his side which knocked him against the wall and attacked the rear guard again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleanor: &#8220;!! 《Heat Ray》!&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra: &#8220;《Killer Shot》!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I approached while avoiding the obstacles from the rear guards by running on the wall. Then, I threw an iron ball with the 《Meteor》 skill immediately to the archer who was fixing her next arrow which went through and smashed her head. Finally, I swung my dagger down while free-falling towards the miss magician, thus dividing her head into two parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;Haah haah, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, the recovered spear user charged in, rolled over and attacked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m the only one left, huh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cast 《Gust》 and threw grains of sand at his face who was shouting while doing the same attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;Guh!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like that, I lifted the spear with the hilt of my dagger, kicked his stomach, pulled him down to the ground, and then used my secret technique, The Nutcrackerーーーa technique that I used on a boy who had touched my buttocks in elementary school which led him having a utilization problemーーーRelease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kellin: &#8220;――――uWAA?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside the silly &#8220;Pakyan&#8221; sound, the spear user who had a surprised look and foams on his mouth will now wait to respawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">《All existing skills level has increased》</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">【Karma value has fallen】</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s over, yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;&#8230;this person is a demon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I returned back to Yuu-san who for some reason, became pigeon-toed and hurried our way to 『Belzenstock City』.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">▼▼▼▼▼▼▼</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;Hey, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Yuu-san, who still seems to not recovered yet, asked such question, let&#8217;s answer it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;I&#8217;m preparing self-made explosives along the passage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;&#8230;Why? The exit is already right there, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;Because the sea will be right above us, the seawater will surge in here if we blow these up, right? It would be tiring to battle immediately every time we encounter someone, hence I&#8217;m trying to buy some time for the other players to reach here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like so, I set up some explosives evenly along the passage immediately after going up the stairs while responding to his questions, not only on the ceiling but also on the ground and walls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;&#8230;would that be alright?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;It&#8217;s not as if they can&#8217;t go nor pass here, and to begin with, the seawater will eventually turn into crystals in this place, right? With that being said, they will be able to pass here again soon, yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;I-<em>I see</em>&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;Alright, it&#8217;s done!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work that I&#8217;ve been doing while we were talking is complete, so let&#8217;s blow it up, that is to say, naturally with a large scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;Now then, we&#8217;ll now leave this place. It will explode in about three minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;Ah, <em>yes.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally get out from the long underground passage along with Yuu-san, who is having distant eyes.</p>
<p>Hmmm, it should be around one week, I guess? The outside air is pleasant and the blue sky is dazzling. Well, I had enjoyed it as much as I wanted in the real world, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While being deeply moved by the scenery, the seawater on the left side of us blew up along with a huge explosion sound rang from the underground passage exit behind us, and thus a whirlpool will be created soon afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">【Karma value has fallen】</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rena: &#8220;It seems like a success, yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yuu: &#8220;&#8230;<em>so it seems.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, if we go a little to the west, we will soon arrive at 『Belzenstock City』.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Lille is agonizing and&#8230;it&#8217;s a troublesome subjugation for graduation, right&#8230;?</span></h2>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align:right;">kurokurori.wordpress.com</h5>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Haah haah haah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hid my chest that was groped until it turned red with both of my hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Pokaaa*&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind me, there lies the figures of Aemia and Lille floating on the water surface with a big bump on each of their head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The structure of the public bath in this world is very similar to the ones in my original world.</p>
<p>In other words, the other side of the wall is the men&#8217;s bath.</p>
<p>……It seems they were able to hear everything as many men strangely bent their hips when going out.</p>
<p>And, on the way home,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man: &#8220;Young miss, you really let out a lustful voice back there&#8230;Uncle couldn&#8217;t help but pant-&#8230;POGEGYAA!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>……because I happened to find a pervert right here, I removed his joints and brought him to the guards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired&#8230;really tired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that being said, it has been six months since I entered this training school.</p>
<p>As we only enter this school for one year, we also have to think about our graduation.</p>
<p>In other words&#8230; it&#8217;s something like a graduation thesis in college.</p>
<p>More precisely, it&#8217;s not a graduation test, but instead a graduation subjugation.</p>
<p>The students have to make a party and defeat the designated monsters.</p>
<p>They will only announce the name of the monsters without mentioning how many should we defeat.</p>
<p>……which means, various things will be scored, including the numbers of monsters that we defeat, the status of the subjugation certification site, the quality of useful materials that we stripped from the monster, and such.</p>
<p>The party that scored high here can go at a higher rank than the normal ones when debuting, and will be treated in various ways.</p>
<p>Conversely, a party with low score will be re-tested, and even if you are allowed to work as an adventurer, you will be tied up with various restrictions and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly speaking&#8230; if their grades are so bad that they can&#8217;t do things in various ways, why bother having to go to a training school. Those kind of people is also present.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are quite a few people who pay not a small amount of money to enter as well.</p>
<p>The reason for that is to have a backup as an experienced adventurers when time comes.</p>
<p>There are various advantages such as being able to teach swordsmanship and magic, and cooperating with difficult requests. Above all, it would be nice if veteran adventurers can remember their faces.</p>
<p>Various restrictions are imposed due to bad results as veteran adventurers will be forced to join their party as supervisors for requests above D rank. Some say that it&#8217;s much better for a beginner party.</p>
<p>Also, many veteran adventurers who are considering their retirement due to age have the privilege of being able to pick their next place of employment (that is, guild staff or instructor at a training school), hence many people are participating in this.</p>
<p>Guilds will also have almost no bad points if they can reduce the mortality rate of new adventurers, the guarantee of a stable life after retirement for veteran adventurers, and acquiring excellent guild staff as a bonus.</p>
<p>In fact, among the guild&#8217;s profits, the ones that comes from training schools and swordsmanship or sorcery classes are also occupying a moderate proportion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story got fairly deviated.</p>
<p>And so, today,</p>
<p>is the final deadline for the party recruitment.</p>
<p>I have already decided to have a party with Aemia and Lille. We also already completed our registration.</p>
<p>&#8230;There are already quite a plenty of parties registered</p>
<p>&#8230;.but there&#8217;s one thing that hasn&#8217;t been decided yet.</p>
<p>Ah, it&#8217;s Daian&#8217;s party.</p>
<p>*Pupuh*!&#8230; It consists of no member except him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia: &#8220;Saachi, you&#8217;re not allowed to laugh, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aemia~&#8230; the person you showed your nude for the first time is blmmmph-&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia desperately blocked my mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia: &#8220;I-I-I-I-It&#8217;s not that I had forgiven him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Then, it&#8217;s fine, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille who has been thinking about something for quite a while clapped her hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Ooh, I remember! It&#8217;s Daian Harvey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;……you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Yeah. If I remember there was a rumor about him being severely glared by the Donovan Special Force&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After hearing that, Aemia vanished. Maybe she&#8217;s going to send a helping hand to Daian. You&#8217;re really too kind&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Hey Lille. What will happen if there&#8217;s someone who couldn&#8217;t form a party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Mmm&#8230; he will be forced to join someone&#8217;s party&#8230;or perhaps form a temporary party with the guild staffs, I guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With guild staffs, huh&#8230;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Saachi&#8230; you&#8217;re making a really terrible face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Lille~&#8230; you&#8217;re grinning too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;What~? It&#8217;s because I just really hate scumbags like Daian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;*chuckle*&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Fufufufu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went looking for the guildmaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a while, Daian as well found his party members.</p>
<p>However, he was beautifully rejected by the students and thus created a temporary party with the guild staffs.</p>
<p>Yes, with the guildmaster.</p>
<p>In addition, the guildmaster is awfully strong, so he&#8217;s giving a handicap with only using one hand.</p>
<p>……He will frequently observe Daian who is now watching the twilight sky alone on the rooftop. Namaste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia: &#8220;Hey, Saachi, Lille. Did you do anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi &amp; Lille: &#8220;&#8221;We didn&#8217;t do anything extravagant.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia turned her head and cast her doubting eyes towards us for a while. She&#8217;s sharp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus.</p>
<p>The monsters for graduation subjugation have been announced.</p>
<p>Each party has different monster target.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for us,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;&#8230;you&#8217;re lying&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia: &#8220;&#8230;this will be tough, I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;&#8230;we&#8217;re being harassed, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was the worst opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a B rank monster.</p>
<p>White Yata.</p>
<p>One target.</p>
<h5>(TL Note: The raw says they only need to hunt one even though she said before that the guild won&#8217;t mention the count for heads, thus they&#8217;re being harassed indeed.)</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Difficult to find.</p>
<p>Even if you can find it, it&#8217;s agile.</p>
<p>Tough.</p>
<p>It will escape immediately.</p>
<p>However, since the monster has no means of attack, it won&#8217;t attack.</p>
<p>It simply ranked “B” because it was “difficult to find” and “unusually high defense”.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a troublesome opponent through and through.</p>
<p>Lille who&#8217;s an attacking vanguard type.</p>
<p>Aemia who specializes in long-range lightning.</p>
<p>And me, a scout that specializes in surprise attack.</p>
<p>……this party balance is terrible if you think carefully!</p>
<p>If at least Aemia can use a bow&#8230;!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aemia: &#8220;*dazed* Pokeee&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impossible! It&#8217;s really impossible for a girl who literally said &#8220;Pokeee&#8230;&#8221; while being in a daze to use a bow!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next is&#8230; I can also be a vanguard, so&#8230;</p>
<p>…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Lilleee~&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;W-what is it? It&#8217;s unpleasant to hear a coaxing voice like that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;I don&#8217;t want a cat like you telling me that.</p>
<h5>(TL Note: &#8220;Coaxing voice&#8221;&#8216;s kanji literal meaning is &#8220;A voice like a cat&#8221;, hence it&#8217;s a kanji pun.)</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Can you&#8230; use a bow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Bows, huh&#8230;well&#8230;I can, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eh!?</p>
<p>What did she say!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;I&#8217;m originally an archer. I entered the warrior class because of my weak proximity awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S-S-Such thing!</p>
<p>I can see angel wings on Lille&#8217;s back &#8230;!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saachi: &#8220;Lille!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lille: &#8220;Waah! What&#8217;s wrong? Don&#8217;t hug me suddenly! WAAAAH! Don&#8217;t touch at strange places! Ah, damn you, don&#8217;t rub there!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;I did a little revenge from last time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B-ranked monster, White Yata.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, White Yatagarasu.</p>
<h5>(TL Note: Yatagarasu = The mythical raven from Japanese folklore)</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>…Can we play football, instead? Sigh&#8230;</p>
<h5>(TL Note: Yes, the one which the ball is kicked. Though, I don&#8217;t know why she said that.)</h5>
